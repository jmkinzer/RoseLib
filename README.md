# RoseLib

**The idea behind this project is detailed in this [paper.](http://www.eventiotic.com/eventiotic/files/Papers/URL/20bd5c00-5abe-43ff-86b6-64c2941d67ce.pdf)** 

**From the abstract:**
> During our research, we found that Roslynâ€™s Syntax Tree API is difficult to use due inherent properties of its implementation. In this paper, we present our RoseLib library that abstracts large part of this implementation, which liberates developers from remembering unnecessary details and makes development process much more efficient.
